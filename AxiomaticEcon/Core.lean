/-! ## Core Structures

These structures define the primitive building blocks of our economic logic system.
They are intentionally minimal and symbolic. Each can be extended later.

-/

/--
  `Actor` represents a human being capable of purposeful action.
  Each actor is assigned a unique natural number identifier.
  In Misesian economics, action is always individual—there is no "group mind."
-/
structure Actor where
  id : Nat
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr

/--
  `End` represents a goal, desire, or outcome the actor aims to achieve.
  Ends are described using a string label for now; they can later be typed or enriched.
  In Austrian economics, ends are subjectively chosen and ordinally ranked.
-/
structure End where
  description : String
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr

/--
  `Means` are scarce resources the actor employs to achieve an end.
  They are also described with a string for now, and assumed to be identifiable and limited.
  The concept of means presupposes scarcity—if they weren’t scarce, they wouldn’t be economized.
-/
structure Means where
  description : String
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr

/--
  `Timepoint` represents a discrete temporal location.
  All action takes place in time: the actor moves from a less satisfactory present to a more satisfactory imagined future.
  This structure allows you to introduce time preference, opportunity cost, or temporal sequencing of actions.
-/
structure Timepoint where
  t : Nat
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr

/-! ## Core Concepts

These are logical relations and concepts that underpin the action-theoretic framework.
They are defined at the level of propositions—statements that can be true or false.
-/

/--
  `Purposeful` is a predicate (truth-valued function) that determines whether an actor's behavior counts as purposeful action.

  **Current Placeholder Logic:**
  We define an action as purposeful if the end and the means have non-empty textual descriptions. This is a symbolic proxy for now.

  **Future Goal:**
  Replace this with a richer definition that ties in preference rankings, choice conditions, or opportunity cost.

  Note: `a : Actor` is not yet used in the definition, but is included to match the general form of the action axiom and allow for future expansion.
-/
def Purposeful (a : Actor) (e : End) (m : Means) : Prop :=
  m.description ≠ "" ∧ e.description ≠ ""

/--
  `DeterminateOutcome` is a placeholder for the idea of a fully known or predictable result of an action.
  It is always defined to be `False` to encode Mises' principle that **action is necessarily speculative**.

  In this system:
  No human action leads to a fully certain outcome in advance.
  This supports the Uncertainty Axiom, which prohibits perfect foresight.
-/
def DeterminateOutcome (a : Actor) (e : End) (m : Means) : Prop := False

/--
  `Prefers` is a fundamental relational axiom indicating that an actor subjectively ranks one end above another.

  For example:
  `Prefers a e₁ e₂` means “Actor `a` prefers end `e₁` over end `e₂`.”

  This relation is **ordinal, not cardinal**—it expresses rank but not intensity or measurable utility.
-/
axiom Prefers : Actor → End → End → Prop

/-! ## Axioms (Misesian)

These are a priori truths accepted as foundational in praxeological economics,
especially following Ludwig von Mises' framework in *Human Action*.
Each is universally quantified—true for all relevant actors, ends, and means.
-/

/--
  **Action Axiom**: Every human action is purposeful.

  This is the first principle of praxeology.
  It asserts that whenever a human acts, they are attempting—by design—to achieve some end using some scarce means.

  Formally:
  For all actors `a`, ends `e`, and means `m`, the triple `(a, e, m)` satisfies the `Purposeful` predicate.
-/
axiom ActionAxiom : ∀ a e m, Purposeful a e m

/--
  **Scarcity Axiom**: All means are scarce.

  Scarcity is what gives rise to the need for economizing, which in turn makes action meaningful.
  If means were unlimited or free, no choice would be required.

  Formally:
  For all means `m`, `m.description ≠ ""`. This symbolizes that every means has some nontrivial identity and is a limited resource.
-/
axiom Scarcity : ∀ m : Means, m.description ≠ ""

/--
  **Uncertainty Axiom**: All human action takes place under uncertainty.

  This aligns with Mises' view that action is always speculative.
  Even if guided by experience or probability, outcomes can never be known with certainty in advance.

  Formally:
  For all `a`, `e`, and `m`, if an action is purposeful, then the outcome is not determinate.
-/
axiom UncertaintyOfAction :
  ∀ a e m, Purposeful a e m → ¬ DeterminateOutcome a e m

/-! ## Example Lemma

This is a sample logical consequence derived from the above axioms and definitions.
It illustrates how propositions can be proven within the system.
-/

/--
  **Lemma: Purposeful action implies scarcity of means.**

  This lemma shows that if an action is purposeful (as per the definition),
  then the means used must be non-empty—i.e., they are scarce.

  It uses `h.left`, which extracts the first part of the conjunction in `Purposeful`.
-/
theorem action_implies_scarcity (a : Actor) (e : End) (m : Means) :
    Purposeful a e m → m.description ≠ "" :=
  fun h => h.left
